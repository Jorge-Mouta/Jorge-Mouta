# Computer Science Project Application // Self-Taught Computer Science // ST-CS

NAME: Pending... (Beyond University)

Mission

The CSPA has as objective to provide a free open-source exposion the Computer Science course materials for all interested.
This platform contents should be self-contained and compacted, should provide all the resources, code editors, math editors, every other tools necessary.
It's important to have a database for students to keep track of their progress.
We should provide a space for discussion and socialization. 
We will strive to present our students with a very well curated selection of learning material. (20 years of self-taught experience)
It's important to us to empower our Self-Taught students and build up their confidance, because they will represent the self-taught movement in the future.
we believe the ST-M credibility is very fragile, unfortunately has been thorn by bad examples and bad examples over-shadow the good ones because they are in much greater numbers, so a big part of our mission is to reinforce the ST-M credibility.  


Manifesto

Our aim is to make masters of Computer Science and not job ready students, althought they will be job ready.
We should avocate for the self-taught culture and try to expand on it.
